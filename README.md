# 🚀 Challenge02-Creating-Shopping-Cart-Hook 🚀

In this challenge, I will have to create an application to practice what I have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where my main goal is to create a shopping cart hook. I will have access to two pages, one component and one hook to implement the features requested in this challenge:

- Add a new product to the cart;
- Remove a product from the cart;
- Change the quantity of a product in the cart;
- Calculating the sub-total and total prices of the cart;
- Stock validation;
- Display error messages;
- Among others.
